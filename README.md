# Inverted-Walker

##  What It Does

The walker is powered by a small motor placed at the lower linkage arm. Through a crankshaft mechanism, the motor converts **rotational energy into translational walking motion**, allowing the robot to "step" its way along the rope.

This makes it ideal for exploring locomotion on suspended lines, tightropes, or overhead cables — a unique mechanical challenge.

##  Files in This Repo

- `CAD/` – Full SolidWorks files of the walker assembly and individual parts.
- `STL/` – 3D-printable files ready for fabrication.
- `Media/` – Renders and diagrams for assembly reference.
- `Docs/` – Technical breakdowns, dimensional analysis

##  Use Cases & Applications

- Experimental robotics
- Rope traversal bots
- Kinematics and crank mechanism demonstrations
- STEM/engineering education projects

##  Build Instructions
- Builing would be intuitive, follow the attached screenshot of the walker and apply motor with appropriate sense of rotation
- Use M4 bolts for fastening
- protip: Test the bot n number of times before final appearance
